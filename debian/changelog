ros-melodic-dingo-control (0.1.1-1stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Improve joy device configurability (#4 <https://github.com/dingo-cpr/dingo/issues/4>)
    * Remove the joy device from the yaml file, but keep it as the default in the launch file. Add support for a DINGO_JOY_DEV environment variable to override the default joy device.
    * Add the ASCII art diagram of the controller from Husky to make it easier to interpret the button mappings, should anyone want to remap them.
    * Expose the yaml file as an additional argument to the teleop launch file, allow overriding it with DINGO_JOY_CONFIG
  * [dingo_control] Added limits for y motion omni platform.
  * [dingo_control] Updated max velocity and acceleration limits.
  * [dingo_control] Updated robot_localization config.
  * [dingo_control] Moved control extras to botton of launch file.

ros-melodic-dingo-control (0.1.0-1stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Fix the controller parameters for omni control; behaviour is now the same as ridgeback
  * Unified Dingo folders/files as much as possible, updated meshes, bumped CMake version and made roslaunch a test depend.
  * Added dingo_control; split dingo_description into separate Dingo-D and Dingo-O flavours; still much work to be done here, but preparing hand-off for Tony
  * Contributors: Chris Iverach-Brereton, Jason Higgins, Tony Baltovski
