ros-noetic-dingo-description (0.1.4-1focal) focal; urgency=high

  * [dingo_description] Switched description.launch to use single Dingo URDF which then determines which file should be loaded.
  * Add a generic dingo.urdf.xacro (#8 <https://github.com/dingo-cpr/dingo/issues/8>)
    * Add a generic dingo.urdf.xacro which will include dingo-d or dingo-o as-needed. This simplifies adding support for manipulators to the robot

ros-noetic-dingo-description (0.1.1-1focal) focal; urgency=high

  * Disable gravity on the L515 links; they were causing the odom frame to drift in gazebo
  * Nav improvements (#5 <https://github.com/dingo-cpr/dingo/issues/5>)
    * Expose the scan_topic argument in the gmapping_demo and amcl_demo launch files
    * Add placeholder support for the RS L515 and D455 so that the gazebo plugins work; the meshes for these sensors don't exist yet, but we can at least get the plugin configured & add the appropriate links for now
    * Refactor the RealSense macro to put the mesh + gazebo plugin in one place. Create a more-accurate L515 mesh out of cylinders until Intel releases an official mesh for the sensor
  * Fix missing quotes around the lidar models
  * Model Update (#3 <https://github.com/dingo-cpr/dingo/issues/3>)
    * Make the yellow of the chassis more yellow and less orange
    * Fix the spawn position of the Hokuyo lidar & its focal point. Add the STLs for the LMS-1xx & Hokuyo lidars.  Add lms1xx as a dependency so that the lidar macro is available.
    * Add additional mounting points for accessories, fix the position of the existing front_mount
    * Start adding support for the Intel RealSense cameras as out-of-the-box accessories
    * Update the dependencies
    * Remove the hector gazebo plugin dependency; it's included in dingo_gazebo, and isn't strictly needed in the description package
    * Refactor the lidar accessory variables, add clarifying comments to make it easier to find supported values for the sensor models
    * Fix the measurements.  Keep the front/rear mounts 5cm back from the bumpers, move the bumper mounts to the center of the bumper
    * Remove the rear_bumper_mount since that's where the HMI is, which would prevent anything from being reasonably mounted there
  * [dingo_description] Switched to find over dirname since it was causing errors in tests.
  * Fix the spawn position of the Hokuyo lidar & its focal point. Add the STLs for the LMS-1xx & Hokuyo lidars.  Add lms1xx as a dependency so that the lidar macro is available.

ros-noetic-dingo-description (0.1.0-1focal) focal; urgency=high

  * Unified Dingo folders/files as much as possible, updated meshes, bumped CMake version and made roslaunch a test depend.
  * Added dingo_control; split dingo_description into separate Dingo-D and Dingo-O flavours; still much work to be done here, but preparing hand-off for Tony
  * Moved IMU
  * Updated joint names for simplicity
  * Fixed collision
  * Added description
