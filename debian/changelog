ros-melodic-dingo-control (0.1.0-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Fix the controller parameters for omni control; behaviour is now the same as ridgeback
  * Unified Dingo folders/files as much as possible, updated meshes, bumped CMake version and made roslaunch a test depend.
  * Added dingo_control; split dingo_description into separate Dingo-D and Dingo-O flavours; still much work to be done here, but preparing hand-off for Tony
  * Contributors: Chris Iverach-Brereton, Jason Higgins, Tony Baltovski
