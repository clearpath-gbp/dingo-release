ros-melodic-dingo-navigation (0.1.0-1stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * [dingo_navigation] Removed maps from install.
  * [dingo_navigation] Unified launch files, made roslaunch a test depend and bumped CMake version.

  * Initial commit of dingo_navigation
  * Contributors: Dave Niewinski, Jason Higgins, Tony Baltovski
