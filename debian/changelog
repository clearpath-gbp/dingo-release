ros-melodic-dingo-navigation (0.1.1-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Nav improvements (#5 <https://github.com/dingo-cpr/dingo/issues/5>)
    * Expose the scan_topic argument in the gmapping_demo and amcl_demo launch files
    * Add placeholder support for the RS L515 and D455 so that the gazebo plugins work; the meshes for these sensors don't exist yet, but we can at least get the plugin configured & add the appropriate links for now
    * Refactor the RealSense macro to put the mesh + gazebo plugin in one place. Create a more-accurate L515 mesh out of cylinders until Intel releases an official mesh for the sensor
